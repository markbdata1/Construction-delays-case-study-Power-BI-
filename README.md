Case Study Background:

Question 1 – Identify Contractors with positive delays

Question 2 – Identify projects with delays


Background:

Identify Critical Path: 
Utilize Critical Path Method (CPM) techniques to identify the critical path of the project. The critical path represents the sequence of activities that determine the project's overall duration. Focus on activities that have the least flexibility for delays.

Risk Management: 
Use data analysis to assess project risks and their potential impact on the schedule. Develop contingency plans to mitigate risks and uncertainties that could lead to delays.

Continuous Improvement: 
Continuously review and refine the scheduling process based on data-driven insights. Encourage feedback from project teams to identify areas for improvement.

Collaboration and Communication: 
Foster strong collaboration and communication among project teams, subcontractors, and stakeholders. Clear communication can help prevent misunderstandings and delays.

Statement:
By integrating data analysis into the scheduling process, project managers can make more informed decisions, anticipate potential delays, and improve overall project performance in the construction industry.
